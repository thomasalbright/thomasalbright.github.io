_A programmer's thoughts on some of the week's happenings._

[iOS devices dominated mobile shopping on Black
Friday](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1838) again.  Looks like
it's still the best mobile platform to to target first, even though
Android is more widely used.

Regardless of which platform is used, [mobile e-commerce over is taking
off this year](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1837).  That matches up
with the usage numbers we have seen on our clients' sites.  I wonder
what the ceiling is for mobile browsing vs traditional desktop
browsing...

Bill McCloskey reported [progress towards making Firefox use multiple
processes](http://billmccloskey.wordpress.com/2013/12/05/multiprocess-firefox/).
  The article goes into some nice low-level detail.

Multiple processes (and the sandboxing it allows) is the main reason
that I use Chrome rather than Firefox.  If this makes it into the
release branch, I will be very tempted to switch back to Firefox.

After rising above $1200 earlier this week, [Bitcoin dropped to $870
earlier
today](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-05/bitcoins-volatility-problem-why-todays-sell-off-wont-be-the-last).
I'm sure people will calm down and talk themselves into reinvesting, and
Bitcoin will continue rising.  But [Alan Greenspan thinks it's a
bubble](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-04/greenspan-says-bitcoin-a-bubble-without-intrinsic-currency-value.html),
and he's pretty smart.  That doesn't mean it won't hit $10,000 and gain
tons of media attention before the bubble bursts, though.

In effort to find a good PGP solution, I played around with
[Mailvelope](http://www.mailvelope.com/), which lets you use PGP with
webmail. However, it's big limitation is that it doesn't enable you to
encrypt attachments, which basically makes it a non-starter.  Until
Google decides to build PGP into GMail, I fear I will never be able to
use it with "normal" people.
