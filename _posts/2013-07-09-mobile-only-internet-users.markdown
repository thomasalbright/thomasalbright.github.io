**We may soon be living in a world where more people use cell phones more often than they use devices with normal, PC-like screens.** In fact, we may soon be living in a world where many people hardly ever use a PC-sized screen.

In America, we have already seen this trend happening:

* 61% of American cell phone owners have a smartphone. ([as of May 2013](http://pewinternet.org/Commentary/2012/February/Pew-Internet-Mobile.aspx))
* 31% of American cell internet users use their phone as their primary internet device. ([as of Apr 2012](http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Cell-Internet-Use-2012/Main-Findings/Cell-Internet-Use.aspx))
* Nearly half of cell internet users ages 18-29 (45%) do most of their online browsing on their phone ([as of Apr 2012](http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Cell-Internet-Use-2012/Main-Findings/Cell-Internet-Use.aspx))
* Convenience is the main reason for that Americans use cell phones as their primary internet device, but 10% of these people do so because they don't have any other Internet access. ([as of Apr 2012](http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Cell-Internet-Use-2012/Main-Findings/Cell-Internet-Use.aspx)) I imagine this number will be higher in developing countries.

In the rest of the world, the mobile Internet market seems primed to boom:

* 3.2 billion people, or 46% of the world's total population of 7 billion, have at least one active mobile (cellular, not just smartphone) device. ([as of Oct 2012](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/10/global-mobile-usage?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/sim_earth))
* 1 billion of those devices are smartphones. ([as of Oct 2012](http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/mobile-milestone-the-number-of-smartphones-in-use-passed-1-billion-in-q3-says-strategy-analytics/))
* Analysts believe that the number of smartphones will double to 2 billion by 2015. ([as of Oct 2012](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/10/global-mobile-usage?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/sim_earth))
* Although I don't have the stats for it, I think it is safe to assume that many of these future smartphone owners in developing countries will not own a PC.

The question is, **what will smartphone usage look like in the developing world?** Will smartphone users be as active as they are in America? Will these users be interested in downloading apps, subscribing to web services, etc.? Will they just use them for basic things like email? Or will they just be buying smartphones because they are the only thing the carriers are selling, and not even use most of the "smart" features?

It's a bit early to tell, but answering these questions will be key for those of us looking to expand into the developing smartphone market.

But right now, even in America, there are many users who only use a smartphone. Are you ready to support "mobile-only" users?
